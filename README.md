# Token Swap & Liquidity Pool Project

This project implements a token creation, liquidity pool, and swapping system. Token metadata is stored on [Pinata](https://www.pinata.cloud/) for decentralized file storage, with a Constant Mean Market Maker (CMMM) algorithm used for the liquidity pool. Users can swap tokens if a liquidity pool is available.

## Features

1. **Token Creation**: Generates new tokens and stores their metadata on Pinata for secure and decentralized access.
2. **Liquidity Pool**: Implements a liquidity pool using the CMMM algorithm, allowing users to provide liquidity.
3. **Token Swapping**: Enables token swapping functionality if a liquidity pool exists.
